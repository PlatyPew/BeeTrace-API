### Low interactive Elasticsearch Plugin for Honeypy

This plugin is based on elastichoney project (https://github.com/jordan-wright/elastichoney)

Very simple only three requests are replied

1. Simple Get request /
2. Request for node information starting with /_nodes
3. Search requests starting with /_search

By default runs on default elasticsearch port 9200.

ToDo:

1. Add randomness to versions in replies
2. Add rnadom numbers for node replies
